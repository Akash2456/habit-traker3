This project is a habit tracker used to track the habits of of the User on daily and weekly basis.

To track habits, you can either select from the existing habits or add a custom habit by typing in the textbox area.

Each habit has a status that can be marked as "Done," "Not Done," or "Not Started" (by default, "Not Started" is selected).

If you no longer need to track a habit, you can delete it from your list.

You can navigate to the Weekly View page to track the status of your habits for the past week.

To change the status of a habit for the current date or past 7 days, you can click on the icon displayed under the corresponding dates.

The icons representing the status of the habit are color-coded:

Red indicates "Not Done"
Green indicates "Done"
Grey indicates "Not Started"
When you change the status of any habit for the current date, it will also be reflected on the Daily View page.

The Daily View page displays habits with a number assigned to each sentence to facilitate clear communication and understanding.
